      The following charts and graphics have been compiled from nearly <mark>*300,000</mark> tweets collected during the
      second and third Presidential Debates held on October 9, 2016 and October 19, 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tweets were passed through a <mark>*semantic analyzer</mark> which attempts to
      determine the positivity or negativity of the author's language. Each tweet was then analyzed for keyword content
      and to determine which candidate was the subject of the tweet.

      attempt to understand the national conversation and strong emotions behind this historic election!
